# NextPier

**Web first. Desktop next.**

A Next.js starter for workbench apps. AnimateIcons, Cult UI, and compact styles are ready to use. Add Wails desktop or Browser Harness AI chat through the CLI.

## Start building

```bash
NEXTPIER_TEMPLATE_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/yayapao/nextpier.git "$NEXTPIER_TEMPLATE_DIR"
node "$NEXTPIER_TEMPLATE_DIR/scripts/init.mjs" --project ./my-app --name my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3900](http://localhost:3900). For a project you already cloned, import with `--project .` inside that repository. Its `.git` and `LICENSE` are preserved; see the [initialization guide](docs/development.md#初始化已-clone-的仓库), including PowerShell commands. Using the NextPier checkout directly? Run `npm install` first.

## Hand it to ChatGPT / Codex

Replace the brackets and send this to ChatGPT / Codex:

```text
Use https://github.com/yayapao/nextpier to create [project name] in [target directory].
npm package name: [lowercase English; digits and hyphens allowed].
Goal: [who uses it and what they need to do]. Workflows: [list them].
Data: [API, database, or single-user local persistence]. Features: [Web / Web+AI / Wails / Wails+AI].
Inspect the target first. Continue an existing NextPier project; initialize a cloned repository containing only .git, LICENSE, README, or similar files in place.
Fetch the template with git clone --depth 1 --branch main into a dedicated temporary directory outside the target.
Run node "[template directory]/scripts/init.mjs" --project "[target directory]" --name "[npm package name]", then run npm install in the target.
Keep the target's .git, history, remote, LICENSE, and user files. Read and merge differences when files conflict.
Read AGENTS.md, docs/README.md, docs/ai-agent.md, and the installed Next.js docs first.
Build the business homepage, data reads and writes, validation, and loading, empty, and error states using the existing components and style rules.
For AI, run npm run upgrade:harness. For desktop, run npm run upgrade:wails with the app name and ID.
Update the name, metadata, and README. Run typecheck, lint, and test:cli; run test:harness when AI is enabled.
Complete the implementation. Do not start dev, build, or package by default. Report commands, check results, and anything still unverified.
```

The [ChatGPT / Codex guide](docs/ai-agent.md) has a fuller prompt and worked scenarios in Chinese.

## Go desktop

```bash
npm run upgrade:wails -- --name MyApp --id com.example.myapp
npm run desktop:doctor
npm run desktop:dev
```

The upgrade generates `desktop/`. Run `npm run desktop:build` to package the app; output goes to `desktop/build/bin/`.

Desktop development requires Go 1.25+, Wails CLI 2.15.0, and platform build dependencies. The app requires Node.js 20.9+ at runtime; Node is not bundled. See the [desktop guide](docs/desktop.md).

## Add AI

```bash
npm run upgrade:harness
npm run harness:doctor
```

Chat, call tools, and confirm writes at `/harness`. Demo mode works without an API key. Replace the model, plugins, or store as your app grows; see [Browser Harness](docs/harness.md). The same runtime works on the web and in Wails.

## Defaults with a point of view

- Next.js 16.2, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.
- AnimateIcons for animated icons, Cult UI for visual components, shadcn/Radix for core interactions.
- Compact Chinese UI, 32px controls, 6px corner radius, semantic colors in both themes.
- Server Components read initial data; client components handle interactions. Forms use React Hook Form + Zod.
- Wails wraps a local Next.js server, keeping Server Actions, Flight, and SSE.
- Optional AI chat with replaceable models, storage, and business plugins. Users confirm write operations.

The homepage is an interactive workbench example. Items live in React state and reset on reload; replace them with your own data when building an app.
